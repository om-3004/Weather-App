# Weather-App
!important --- I have not pushed the node modules folder which contains all the dependencies for the project including react itself (beacuse it is huge inSo size).
So if you FORK or CLONE the project, then after cloning it, just type "npm install" in your terminal to install the node modules folder and install all the dependencies required for the project.

The Weather App is developed using React.js. An API is used to fetch the data about the weather of different places across the globe. I have used an API of openweathermap.org. The different thing about this weather app is that the background image of the page changes according to the temperature of the place you have searched.
If the temperature is less than 16 degree celsius than the background will be changes to cool backgroung and for more than that it will change to warm background.
